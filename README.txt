Hello, my name is Walter, and these are my first two projects in Python, in the context of "Argentina Programa 4.0".
AP4.0 was a State Program for teaching different programming languages. In my case, I chose Python.
The course was given online, for 8 months, with professors from the National University of San Luis.
Upon passing the final project, I was awarded the title of Junior Python Developer.
Here you will find the Final Project in two modes: one with Imperative Paradigm, the other with OOP.
As I describe in my profile, this was my restart with programming, and I don't intend to leave it anymore...
